#  Creating a Web Page using HTML, CSS & Javascript

## Part 1
* Your page should have at least two different parts, one containing some personal information 
(like your name, where you're from, etc.), and another set of links. You should include both 
internal links (that jump to locations within the info page) and external links that would lead to 
other pages on the web (like something related to one of your hobbies, etc).
* Your info page must have your name prominently centered at the top. 
* There should be several sections to the info page (e.g., Personal Info, Hobbies, Favorite Links), 
each with its own heading. At least one section must have multiple paragraphs in it. 


## Part 2 
* Your info page should perform some text formatting (bold, italics, color, BIG) but try not to 
overdue it to the point that the content is compromised. 
* You should include a favorite quote, e.g., a poem or line from a movie. 
* There should be at least one list (e.g., your top-ten favorite CDs). 
* There should be at least 5 links in the page, including a link to the BRAC University and to the 
CSE 391 Piazza page. At least one of those links must occur in a sentence.


## Part 3

* There should be at least 2 images in the page, one of which must be stored locally along with 
the Web page. 
* There must be at least one table, some of whose rows are more than one line long. 
* The page's location and last modification date should be automatically displayed at the bottom. 
(Use JavaScript here.) 
* Your page must make use of a style sheet that defines basic formatting style, including the 
format of tables. The style sheet should be defined in a separate file and linked to your page. 
You can also use some inline directives for a few of the simple styles (like making bold-faced
text). 

Important note: Your page should use standard HTML (and CSS) features only, so that it will 
be viewable using either Internet Explorer, Netscape (Firefox), Safari, etc. While it may not look 
exactly the same due to inconsistencies and variations in the browser implementations, your page 
should look reasonable under any such browser. 

## Part 4

Your homepage should have a nice (professional) look and its code should satisfy common 
standards. In particular, for maximum points here, your webpage should satisfy the Strict 
XHTML 1.0 (or 1.1) standards (including a proper Document Type Declaration in the HTML 
file). You should pass it through tidy and validator (links are below). Please contact me for such 
evaluation only if it is needed.
